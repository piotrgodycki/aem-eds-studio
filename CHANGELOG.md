## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Biome 2 and TypeScript 7; the tutorial's step dots and two effects follow the new lint rules** (STUDIO-89)

### Removed
- **Leftovers: the old top bar's styles, an unused type and option, stale comments; the engine's minimum version in one place (0.4.69)** (STUDIO-83)

### Added
- **Setup window: what the studio still needs (engine, Git, an agent, GitHub, Figma token) and a fix for each; it opens by itself when something required is missing** (STUDIO-85)
- **Engine aem-eds-kit 0.4.69: the screenshot check uses Figma REST with a token (no MCP call), or the scraped page** (STUDIO-78)
- **Choose how the design is read: Figma through REST or MCP, other pages public or signed in** (STUDIO-76)
- **Delete a draft from the project's list** (STUDIO-74)

### Fixed
- **The screenshot check says what it costs (+1 REST or MCP call, or none for a scraped page) instead of "free"** (STUDIO-87)
- **The app quits right away even while the page is polling (the packaged smoke test hung on it)** (STUDIO-85)
- **Full screen preview works again** (STUDIO-72)
